##NBA Jamz Statskeepr

###This activity was built on Day 4 of Epicodus using Ember.js.

###It allows users to either select a team that has already been created or give them the ability to add their own. Additionally, users will be allowed to select players from their chosen team. Prebuilt players come with avatars, while players that are added at a later date - will not.

###Stats for individual players can be tracked when a user selects a player's specific shot. Total points are then tracked.
